# Learning-Log

A Learning Log Web Application project from Python Crash Course book.

<a href="https://learninglog-jakubberkowski.b4a.run/">Visit a deployed version of App!</a>

This App is a kind of blog where registered users can create entries (private or public) about anything they learn.

Stack:
- Python,
- Django,
- Bootstrap.

The main goal of this project was to get familiar with Django framework and deployment process of web application.
Please note that there are changes (e.g. deployment on Back4App instead of Heroku) and improvements (e.g. creation of public topics) compared to the version in the book.
